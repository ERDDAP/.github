# ERDDAP

ERDDAP is a scientific data server that gives users a simple, consistent way to download subsets of gridded and tabular scientific datasets in common file formats and make graphs and maps. ERDDAP is a Free and Open Source (Apache and Apache-like) Java Servlet from NOAA NMFS SWFSC Environmental Research Division (ERD).

Over the last decade, the usage of ERDDAP has exploded. What was once a primarily NOAA-driven and -used software tool is now depended upon by approximately 100 organizations in at least 16 countries. With increased adoption, ERDDAP development has also moved into the community-supported, GitHub-based, open source model that has proven successful in many other projects. As a result, this is an opportune time to implement a structure in which ERDDAP development can continue to grow and thrive.

This GitHub organization is the first step in this movement for ERDDAP.
